# Task app - Backend server with Express


A simple backend that was created for a tasks app in order to practice Express JS.

## Available API Endpoints

### GET /api/tasks
- Fetches all tasks from the database

### POST /api/tasks
- Accepts a new task as JSON and adds it to the database.

Note: Currently, tasks are stored in memory, so they will be lost when the server restarts.



## Tools used:


- **Express JS**
- **JavaScript**


## TODO:
- Integrate an SQL database to persist data
- Add an API endpoint to update an existing task
